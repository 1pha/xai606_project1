# Financial Scoring Model (#30)
This project is 1st selection of proposed projects from Neural Networks and Applications (XAI606) 2021 Fall.

## Project Description


### Dataset: HELOC


**HELOC**, Home Equity Line Of Credit, dataset consist of borrower's past transaction, inquires and other states and their success/failure of lending loans.
+ `ExternalRiskEstimate` - consolidated indicator of risk markers (equivalent of polish BIKâ€™s rate)
+ `MSinceOldestTradeOpen` - number of months that have elapsed since first trade
+ `MSinceMostRecentTradeOpen` - number of months that have elapsed since last opened trade
+ `AverageMInFile` - average months in file
+ `NumSatisfactoryTrades` - number of satisfactory trades
+ `NumTrades60Ever2DerogPubRec` - number of trades which are more than 60 past due
+ `NumTrades90Ever2DerogPubRec` - number of trades which are more than 90 past due
+ `PercentTradesNeverDelq` - percent of trades, that were not delinquent
+ `MSinceMostRecentDelq` - number of months that have elapsed since last delinquent trade
+ `MaxDelq2PublicRecLast12M` - the longest delinquency period in last 12 months
+ `MaxDelqEver` - the longest delinquency period
+ `NumTotalTrades` - total number of trades
+ `NumTradesOpeninLast12M` - number of trades opened in last 12 months
+ `PercentInstallTrades` - percent of installments trades
+ `MSinceMostRecentInqexcl7days` - months since last inquiry (excluding last 7 days)
+ `NumInqLast6M` - number of inquiries in last 6 months
+ `NumInqLast6Mexcl7days` - number of inquiries in last 6 months (excluding last 7 days)
+ `NetFractionRevolvingBurden` - revolving balance divided by credit limit
+ `NetFractionInstallBurden` - installment balance divided by original loan amount
+ `NumRevolvingTradesWBalance` - number of revolving trades with balance
+ `NumInstallTradesWBalance` - number of installment trades with balance
+ `NumBank2NatlTradesWHighUtilization` - number of trades with high utilization ratio (credit utilization ratio - the amount of a credit card balance compared to the credit limit)
+ `PercentTradesWBalance` - percent of trades with balance


### Task & Goal
There are 2 aims for this.
1. Improve performance.
   + Proposal baseline has 70.77% in F1, 73% in Accuracy

2. Find features which best explains the model

## Proposed Methods

### 1. Improving Performance
1. Tree-based Classifiers
   + Find the best classifier with TPOT
   + Other AutoML libraries to reduce labouring cost
2. Neural Networks
   
   I also tried deep neural networks, since the proposal insisted that deep learning models does not have enoguth interpretability nor satisfying performance from them. However, from [this survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.01889.pdf) one point out that there are numerous deep learning architectures proposed to deal with tabular data, even with explainability. Models below are the models proposed in my pipeline.
   + [**TabNet**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07442.pdf) - New deep learning model that was proposed to deal with tabular data. [Code Implementation](https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/tabnet)
   + [**Tab Transformer**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.06678.pdf) - One of newly proposed attention-based multilayer perceptron. [Code Implementation](https://github.com/lucidrains/tab-transformer-pytorch)
   + [**SAINT**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01342.pdf) - . [Code Implementation](https://github.com/somepago/saint)

### 2. Finding features
From [Yu Zhang](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.14261.pdf), interpretability of the neural networks are as follows.

Since this work tries to find a general trends in predicting the successful lending, I have focused on using passive and global method for inspecting the features. Since LIME and Shap are suitable for finding such interpretations, I have used these libraries to find the features that best explains this.

Furthermore, I add i.i.d. Gaussian noise to features one by one, which is example of a perturbation method, and find the feature that disrupts performance the most.

## Results
### Tree-based Classifiers
Through TPOT, we got the best model of XGBoost with NNF1-score. 


### TabNet

### Tab Transformer
